Bounded p-adic measures
=======================

The :doc:`volkenborn` functional has a separate API and normalization.
Its normalized averages and Bernoulli moments are not silently treated as
the bounded measures in this chapter.

Rational Amice data
--------------------

``RationalAmiceMeasure`` specifies a bounded Qp-valued measure on Zp by
its complete rational Amice transform, rather than a finite atom list:

.. math::

   A_\mu(T)=\frac{P(T)}{Q(T)}=\sum_{n\geq0}a_nT^n,
   \qquad a_n=\int_{\mathbb Z_p}{x\choose n}\,d\mu(x).

Numerator and denominator are exact rational polynomials. Common factors
are cancelled before domain checks, then Q is normalized to Q(0)=1.
Every other normalized denominator coefficient must be p-integral.
The constructor verifies this condition; it does not infer boundedness
from a finite numerical sample.

If b is the minimum numerator coefficient valuation, the recurrence
``a_n=P_n-sum(Q_j*a_(n-j), j>=1)`` proves ``v_p(a_n)>=b`` by induction.
The measure/Amice correspondence then gives a bounded measure, after
scaling to the integral-coefficient case. Zero measures use the safe
bound b=0. The bound is sufficient and need not be optimal.

On v_p(T)>=1, Q(T) is a unit: its constant coefficient is one and every
other term has positive valuation. Numerical evaluation uses the complete
rational expression, so it has no artificial series cutoff.

.. doctest::

   >>> K = Qp(5, 18)
   >>> mu = RationalAmiceMeasure(K, [1], [2, 1])
   >>> mu.amice_series(5).coefficients
   (Fraction(1, 2), Fraction(-1, 4), Fraction(1, 8), Fraction(-1, 16), Fraction(1, 32))
   >>> mu.valuation_bound
   0
   >>> mu.amice(K(5)).is_congruent(Fraction(1, 7))
   True
   >>> mu.laplace(K(5)).is_congruent(1/(1+exp(K(-5))))
   True

The example ``1/(2+T)`` passes the boundedness criterion for odd p.
It fails at p=2 because its coefficients have unbounded negative
2-adic valuation. For instance ``1/(3+T)`` is available at p=2.
Scalar denominator powers of p are allowed when normalization only
rescales the numerator; ``1/p`` is a bounded constant transform.

Moments, integration and convolution
--------------------------------------

Ordinary moments are recovered exactly using Stirling numbers of the
second kind, denoted S(n,k):

.. math::

   \int x^n\,d\mu(x)=\sum_{k=0}^n S(n,k)\,k!\,a_k.

Polynomial integration follows by linearity. Additive convolution
multiplies Amice transforms; addition and exact rational scaling are
also implemented. Operations check that the prime agrees and preserve
the bounded rational class.

.. doctest::

   >>> mu.moment(0), mu.moment(1), mu.moment(2), mu.moment(3)
   (Fraction(1, 2), Fraction(-1, 4), Fraction(0, 1), Fraction(1, 8))
   >>> mu.integrate_polynomial(Polynomial([1, 2, 3]))
   Fraction(0, 1)
   >>> mu.convolve(mu).laplace(K(5)).is_congruent(mu.laplace(K(5))**2)
   True
   >>> mu.scale(2).moment(0)
   Fraction(1, 1)
   >>> atom = AtomicMeasure(K, [(-2, 1), (3, 2)])
   >>> converted = RationalAmiceMeasure.from_atomic(atom)
   >>> converted.amice_series(12) == atom.amice_series(12)
   True

Conversion from atomic data is supported for integer points, including
negative integers through denominator powers of 1+T. Noninteger rational
points generally require algebraic transforms and are explicitly rejected.

Mahler coefficients with an explicit tail contract
---------------------------------------------------

A continuous function on Zp has a Mahler expansion in binomial polynomials.
For known exact coefficients c_0,...,c_(N-1), suppose the caller has
established a uniform lower bound B on the valuations of all omitted c_n.
Then

.. math::

   \int f\,d\mu-\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}c_na_n\ \in O(p^{B+b}).

``integrate_mahler`` returns this enclosure. The caller must establish
continuity and the infinite tail bound; the library cannot prove them
from a finite coefficient prefix. An omitted tail is never silently
assumed to be zero. ``integrate_polynomial`` handles exact finite input
without that additional contract.

.. doctest::

   >>> # (1+5)^x has exact Mahler coefficients 5^n, with tail valuation >=N.
   >>> value = mu.integrate_mahler([5**n for n in range(12)], tail_valuation=12)
   >>> value.precision
   12
   >>> value.is_congruent(mu.amice(5), precision=12)
   True

An exact generating-function bridge
------------------------------------

For odd p and A(T)=1/(2+T), the common rational generating function gives
the following exact rational moment identity for every integer k>=0:

.. math::

   m_k=(-1)^k(1-2^{k+1})\zeta(-k).

Indeed the exponential generating series of these moments is
``A(exp(t)-1)=1/(1+exp(t))``; the Bernoulli generating formula gives
the displayed coefficients. The local Laplace convention instead uses
``A(exp(-t)-1)``. Thus its Taylor coefficients are ``(-1)^k*m_k/k!``.

.. doctest::

   >>> all(mu.moment(k) == (-1)**k*(1-2**(k+1))*zeta_special(-k) for k in range(15))
   True

This compares exact moment data of the rational generating function.
It is not a theorem identifying zeros of complex and p-adic zeta functions.
See the measure/Amice references in :doc:`references` for the underlying
correspondence, and the Bernoulli/zeta source there for the special values.

Scope
------

This class implements bounded rational Amice measures. Exact restriction
to units and branched Mellin evaluation, including certified Mahler tails,
are described in :doc:`mellin`. Arbitrary bounded-measure coefficient
oracles and inverse transforms remain future work.
The local Laplace domain here is the sufficient domain for all of Zp:
``v_p(t)>1/(p-1)``. Special support can justify wider domains in other APIs.
