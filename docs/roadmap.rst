Scope, release readiness and roadmap
====================================

Version 0.1 is a working research library with explicit mathematical domains.
It is not a complete replacement for Sage, PARI/GP or a general computer
algebra system. A useful notion of completeness is a documented API with
verified behavior in its declared scope, followed by staged extensions.

Implemented
-----------

* Exact rational conversion and finite precision Qp ball arithmetic, including
  nonintegral values, valuation and precision checks.
* Certified unramified quadratic fields with an integral power basis,
  common ideal-ball precision, uniformizer p, exact F_(p**2) residues,
  inverses, algebraic norm/trace and lifted Frobenius, including Q3(i)
  and the unramified quadratic extension of Q2.
* Certified Eisenstein quadratic fields, including Q2(i) with pi=1+i,
  weighted valuation, staggered Qp coordinate precision, exact prime
  residues and different-aware norm/trace bounds at tame and wild primes.
* Local exp/log/log1p/sin/cos and principal-unit powers over Qp and both
  quadratic engines, with ramification-aware tails and log(p)/log(pi)
  branches. Odd/dyadic square roots and simple-root Hensel lifting over Qp.
* Multiplicative theta3 and theta4 constants with tail bounds.
* Exact Bernoulli/classical-zeta special values and numerical even KL branches
  on Zp away from the point s=1, with a documented branch convention.
* Exact rational polynomials and formal power series; optional SymPy function
  nodes and numerical evaluation with domain checks.
* Exact atomic measures on Zp, moments, branched Mellin transforms on units,
  local Laplace transforms, and formal/numerical Amice transforms.
* Bounded rational Amice measures with a checked coefficient bound, exact
  moments/polynomial integration, local Laplace evaluation, convolution and
  conditional Mahler-prefix integration with an explicit caller tail bound;
  exact restriction to units and branched Mellin evaluation with certified
  tails for odd primes and p=2.
* Rational-centered polynomial Taylor jets, exact polynomial translation,
  and local p-adic Taylor expansions with certified tails for polynomials,
  exp/log/log1p/sin/cos, including certified quadratic centers.
* Analytic coefficient-ball families over Qp and both quadratic fields,
  exact/function factories, explicit closed discs, full coefficient-tail
  bounds, arbitrary-order derivatives, normalized primitives and arithmetic.
* Volkenborn integration of exact polynomials and certified analytic-series
  families, affine charts, extension-valued coefficients and full-tail bounds.
* Scalar first-order linear ODEs with variable analytic coefficients over Qp
  and both quadratic fields, exact/ball initial data, automatic sufficient
  convergence discs and factorial-majorant solution tail bounds.
* Rational/Gaussian diagonal bridges, selected split places, quaternion and
  biquaternion scalar base changes, and an explicit even-Clifford isomorphism.
* Chosen Gaussian local-field embeddings at all primes, with absolute
  uniformizer precision, rational/quaternion/biquaternion field adapters
  and compatible sparse Clifford coefficient maps.
* Exact Q/Q[i] and local-field dense matrices, scalar/matrix arithmetic,
  division-free determinants, certified square solves and inverses,
  complete pivoting and uniformizer/base-normalized condition exponents.
* Exact additive characters, real Haar volumes/integration, finite Fourier
  transforms and compactly supported locally constant functions on Qp with
  rational/cyclotomic source values; exact inversion, Parseval and convolution.
* Amplitude-one Kozyrev wavelets with exact norms, finite orthogonal
  decomposition/reconstruction, positive integer-order whole-Qp Vladimirov
  derivatives with full exterior tails, conservative regional ball generators
  and numerical heat evolution with a reproducible boundary/refinement example.
* A source-linked HTML guide and executable examples.

Next mathematical features
--------------------------

The next calculus steps are linear ODE systems, nonlinear equations and
multivariate derivatives. General analytic-series inversion/composition and sharper
repeated-primitive bounds also remain future work.

1. Broader independent Sage/PARI oracle coverage and performance baselines,
   particularly around KL branches and near poles.
2. Higher-degree unramified/Eisenstein extensions and certified changes of
   ramified power basis. Both degree-two field engines already propagate
   ideal precision and support elementary analysis. Extension square roots,
   public Teichmueller lifts and noncommutative analytic functions remain
   separate work; formal coefficient algebras retain their wider scope.
3. Singular Hensel lifting, general polynomial factorization, rectangular
   matrix/kernel/rank algorithms with precision certificates, optimal lattice
   precision and optional sparse/accelerated arithmetic backends.
4. General Dirichlet characters, the removable s=1 limits of nonprincipal
   branches, p-adic gamma/polylogarithms and larger-prime zeta algorithms.
5. Theta1/theta2 with explicit fractional-power choices, lattice theta series
   and the geometric data required for rigid-analytic theta comparisons.
6. General number-field places and invariants that have proved comparison
   theorems across completions. Any proposed complex-zero bridge needs a
   separate theorem and must not be inferred from agreement at special values.
7. Arbitrary bounded-measure coefficient oracles and justified inverse
   transforms. For a user-supplied general Mahler prefix, integration still
   requires a caller-supplied uniform bound for omitted coefficients.
8. General real-order operators, whole-space numerical heat evolution,
   multidimensional harmonic grids, accelerated Fourier backends and more
   general complex source coefficients.
   Preserve the distinction between exact finite test functions and a
   controlled approximation to an arbitrary function on Qp.

Research applications
----------------------

The reusable mathematics belongs in the library; concrete models should
come with reproducible examples and declared assumptions.

* UBT/physics: biquaternion field operators, finite prime-sector spectra,
  Gram matrices of theta modes, Hilbert symbols and local algebra invariants.
  Test proposed dynamics and convergence from finite models explicitly.
* Markets: ultrametric asset hierarchies, wavelet/theta features and regime
  diagnostics, with chronological evaluation, costs and ordinary baselines.
  A data encoding and an out-of-sample benefit must be demonstrated.
* RH: adelic local zeta integrals, Mellin/Poisson identities, bounded-measure
  moment comparisons, an optional rigorous complex Arb/FLINT backend,
  certified zero counts and controlled finite-torus/prime-cutoff limits.
  Finite numerical checks do not establish RH or identify complex and
  p-adic zeros.

PyPI release preparation
------------------------

``pyproject.toml`` defines the distribution, import package, optional extras,
metadata and build backend. Both wheel and source distribution are generated
with ``python -m build``. The release workflow is manual and defaults to
TestPyPI; no upload is triggered by an ordinary push or pull request.

Before a first public release the owner must select a license and add its
text/metadata, settle the distribution/import name, configure a PyPI account
and Trusted Publisher, and approve the actual upload. A missing license is a
project release-policy gate in the supplied workflow, not a claim that PyPI
technically refuses all unlicensed distributions.

No new license has been assigned to the owner's existing work. The manual
contains third-party references rather than copied implementations. Existing
package-name availability is only a point-in-time observation; a successful
release, not a failed lookup, establishes that a name can be registered.
